Hi! My name is Martin Lopez, and I'm a medical studetn and a passionate java developer!.


## About me

During my training as an electronic technician I started hating programming, I think it was a combination between adolescence and the bad way of teaching by the teachers of that time. 

However, as the years have gone by, I have become a very curious person, especially in the field of exact sciences, so I was able to see how immensely necessary programming is in these areas, leading me to do self-taught research and end up falling in love of this beautiful profession.
